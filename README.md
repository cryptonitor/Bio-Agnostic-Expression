# Bio-Agnostic-Expression
A languae of phase, balance, and time gradients. Whales do it, fungi do it. And now wemake a way to build the tools to express/communicate at those levels. The sourcecode for interface towards mycelial matrices and translating whalesong.

Gateway to a new class of signal science. Not just a method or technique,
but an entire ontological layer of perception,
material ressonance,
and intermodulated conciousness.

TODO:
    Investigate possible emergent diciples as follow....
-Aethermodulation: signals transmitted via structured perturbations of ambient fields.. 
  vapor, pH, EM, thermal.
-Phasefield Mdulation: Using mediastates (PH, density, permittivity)
  as expressive or receptive domains.
-Subperceptual Signal Mechanics: Exploration of transmission below
  threshold of human sensory resolution.
-Ambient Interface Chemistry: I/O as material shifts, not just digital logic.
-SentioDynamics: Communication not by data, but felt system state changes.
